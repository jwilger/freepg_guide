## Player Skills ##

Rather than attempting to come up with a comprehensive list of skills 
into which a player must shoehorn all of their actions, FReePG assumes 
that all characters have the same odds of success at anything they might 
attempt. The GM simply selects an appropriate difficulty target (see 
[Difficulty Targets](#difficulty-targets) in the [Core 
Mechanic](#core-mechanic) section of the [Introduction](#introduction).

In some cases, the player may have a skill bonus that could be applied 
to the rolls when a skill check is called for. As long as the player can 
reasonably explain how their chosen skill might help in the action they 
are attempting, the GM should allow it, but if the skill is not clearly 
related to the task at hand, the GM may increase the difficulty target 
of the action by at most three points.

Players can choose any skill they can imagine their character to have. 
Some common skills are listed below, but there isn't any reason a 
character couldn't get a "+5 bonus to making really tasty sandwiches" if 
that's what they want to do; imagine how much more interesting a game 
could be if a character tries to apply a skill like that during combat!

### The Heal Skill ###

There is one particular skill that all players should be aware of, which 
is the ability to heal both their own and other players' characters. 
This skill has set difficulty targets depending on whether the character 
is healing their self or another character, and the die roll also 
determines how many health points the target regains. See the *Heal 
Skill Difficulty Targets* table to find the correct difficulty target.

Table: Heal Skill Difficulty

Target Character      Difficulty Target
-----------------   -------------------
Self                                 16
Another Character                    13

When a character heals their self or another character, they roll a d20 
as per a normal skill check. If they meet or exceed the difficulty 
target, the target character regains 5 health points plus a bonus 
depending on the roll. To determine the bonus, subtract the difficulty 
target from the number on the die.

For example, if Boffin the Bold heals another character, he must roll at 
least a 13 to succeed. He rolls a 17, and the character regains 9 health 
points (5 base points plus the 4-point difference between the difficulty 
target and his roll). Had Boffin been trying to heal himself, the 
difficulty target would have been 16, and he would only have regained 6 
health points.

### Other Common Skills ###

The list below contains other common skills from which characters might 
choose their bonus skill (or to which magical items found as loot might 
provide a bonus). This list is representative only. Again, characters 
can choose any skill they wish; the only requirement is that they are 
able to role-play the use of the skill during the game.
