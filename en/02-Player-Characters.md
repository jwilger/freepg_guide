# Player Characters #

Each player in a FReePG game will need at least one character to use in 
the game. FReePG has no concept of race or class within the game rules, 
but that doesn't mean a character doesn't have these things. A player 
character can be absolutely any kind of creature the player can imagine; 
race and class are used to enhance the story rather than affect the 
rules of the game.

## Creating a Character ##

Make sure each player has an index card, pencil and access to a 20-sided 
die. Ask the players to take a moment to think about what kind of 
creature their character is. What do they look like? Are they a barbaric 
fighter with a shaggy beard and a deadly short sword in each hand, an 
agile assassin with dagger and crossbow, or a friendly wizard who uses 
their deadly spells to protect the realm? The only think that matters is 
that its a character the player wants to play. Have each player write 
the name of the character along the top of the index card and a short 
description of the character on the line below.

### Base Speed ###

Each character starts off with a base speed of 5, which means that they 
can move 5 squares on their turn (see the [Movement](#movement) chapter 
for more information on moving around.)

Some players may imagine a winged character that can fly; rather than 
create special rules for different characters, assume that *all* 
characters have access to flight capabilities either because of the type 
of creature they are or because of some magical (or technological) 
enhancement. All characters have a base fly speed of 3 (again, the 
[Movement](#movement) chapter has more information.)

Have each player write the following on their character card:

    Speed: 5
    Fly:   3

### Health Points ###

Each character starts out with a certain number of health points that 
represent the character's ability to sustain wounds in the game. During 
combat or when failing a dangerous skill check characters will lose 
health points. Characters can find health potions in the game that will 
heal their wounds (see the [Loot](#loot) chapter), and other characters 
can use an action to heal another character or themselves (see [Player 
Skills](#player-skills) below.)

All characters start out with a base of 50 health points plus a health 
bonus. To calculate the bonus, roll a 20-sided die and divide the result 
by 2. Round the result down to the nearest whole number (thus a roll of 
1 results in no bonus while a roll of 20 results in a 10-point bonus).

Have each player calculate their health points and write the number on 
their character card, for example:

    Max Health: 62

See the section on [Character Death](#character-death) to find out what 
happens when a character loses all of their health points.

### Skill Bonus ###

Each character gets a single +5 bonus to any skill of their choice. See 
the section on [Player Skills](#player-skills) for information on 
choosing skills. Have the player write this skill bonus on their 
character card, e.g.:

    Jumping Really Far: +5

## Character Death ##

When a character loses all of their health points, they are unconscious 
and dying, and they cannot take any actions on their turn. If one full 
round of play passes (every other player character has finished their 
turn since the character started dying) and the character has not been 
healed to greater than 0 health points, the character is dead.

But hey, death isn't very fun, right? Don't worry, all is not lost. When 
a character dies, they are resurrected at the nearest portal (see the 
[Terrain Features](#terrain-features) section of the 
[Movement](#movement) chapter for more information on portals) or, if no 
portals have yet been discovered, at the starting point of the 
adventure.

The resurrected character starts out without any of their equipment or 
treasure, but they can get their treasure back by returning to the 
square where they died. Depending on the number of turns it takes for 
them to return to that square, some of their items will have been 
carried off by scavengers. Consult the table below to determine how much 
of their items (by value, see the [Loot](#loot) chapter for information 
on item values) can be regained.

Table: Percentage of Loot Reclaimed after Resurrection

  Number of Turns     Percentage of Loot by Value
-----------------   -----------------------------
              0-1                            100%
                2                             75%
                3                             50%
                4                             25%
                5                            None

If the character regains less than 100% of their loot, it is up to the 
player which items to keep and which must be discarded. The percentage 
is a maximum. Say a character has two items worth 50 gp each and an item 
worth 200 gp when they die. If it takes them 3 turns to get to the 
square where the character died, they can only keep a maximum of 50% of 
their loot. The character would have to keep the two 50 gp items and 
discard the 200 gp item.
