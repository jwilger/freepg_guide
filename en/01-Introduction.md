# Introduction #

FReePG is a table-top role-playing game system designed to be fun for both new
and experienced gamers. In particular, it is intended to be a great way to
introduce children to the fun and imaginative world of RPGs (Role-playing
Games) without requiring them to memorize and understand large and complicated
sets of rules.
