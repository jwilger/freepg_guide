# Introduction #

\pagestyle{headings}

FReePG is a table-top role-playing game system designed to be fun for both new
and experienced gamers. In particular, it is intended to be a great way to
introduce children to the fun and imaginative world of RPGs (Role-playing
Games) without requiring them to memorize and understand large and complicated
sets of rules. In fact, the only person who really needs to read the 
rules for the game is the Game Master (GM) who will be running the game 
for the players.

While other RPG systems provide players with numerous options for their 
characters' races, classes and powers (and then require the players to 
remember how to use those things), FReePG has *limitless* possibilities 
and&mdash;at the same time&mdash;greatly simplifies the rules such that 
a brand new player can join the game and know all they need within just 
a few minutes.

Although FReePG is freely available, the reason the word "free" is part 
of the title is that the system frees the players (and the GM) to use 
their imaginations and participate in the telling of a story in whatever 
way they see fit. FReePG is therefore an appropriate system for *any* 
genre of story that involves exploration of an environment and combat 
with GM-controlled opponents; it can be used to tell a science fiction 
story with laser guns and aliens just as well as a story of armored 
heroes, wizards and dragons.

Wherever your and your players' imaginations take a story, FReePG 
provides *just enough* rules to add the game element to your play.

This guide will show you, the Game Master, how to help your players 
create characters, how to run combat and exploration using your battle 
mat, and how to provide appropriate enemies to fight and treasures to 
loot. Although this guide is intended for the GM, there's no reason your 
players shouldn't read it as well if they are interested. However, 
players are not required to read the guide prior to playing; the GM can 
simply walk them through the rules of the game during play.
