## Types of Movement ##

On their turn a player may use one or more of their actions to move. The 
following types of movement are legal in FReePG (although if your 
players come up with something that isn't in this list, feel free to let 
them do it and use this list as a guideline to determine how to resolve 
the movement.)

Walk
  : The character moves a number of squares equal to their current
    speed (base speed adjusted for bonuses and/or penalties).

Run
  : The character moves up to two squares beyond their walking speed,
    but they take a -2 penalty to all die rolls until the beginning of 
    their next turn.

Shift
  : The character can carefully move one square without being subject to
    opportunity attacks (see the [Combat](#combat) chapter for more on 
    opportunity attacks).

Fly
  : The character moves a number of squares equal to their current fly
    speed (base fly speed adjusted for bonuses and/or penalties). One 
    square of movement is also used for each 5 feet of elevation change. 
    If the character is not standing on a horizontal surface at the end 
    of their turn, they must succeed at a dt-10 skill check to avoid 
    falling. In addition, strong wind may effect their final position 
    (see [Terrain Features](#terrain-features) below).

Dive
  : Similar to running (and with the same penalties applied) with the
    exception that the additional squares of movement must each take the 
    character closer to the ground (or in whichever direction the 
    character would travel if falling.)

Swim
  : A character can swim through water at their walk speed, however, the
    current may effect their final position (see [Terrain 
    Features](#terrain-features) below).

Stand
  : A character that is sitting or laying prone must spend an action on
    their turn to stand up before they are able to move from their 
    current square.

Falling
  : If a character is forcibly moved into a position where they would
    fall, they must make a dt-15 skill check to avoid falling.
