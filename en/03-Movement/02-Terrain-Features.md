## Terrain Features ##

Walking through an endless landscape of flat, solid floors and sturdy 
walls would get a little boring, so add some terrain features to your 
maps to make the world a little more exciting. The [Building 
Encounters](#building-encounters) chapter provides advice and random 
tables for adding elements to your encounter areas, but the following 
types of terrain features are those that affect character movement by 
providing either a bonus or a penalty to any creature that enters a 
square containing such a feature.

Portal Squares
  : Portal squares are usable by any intelligent creature, although it
    is rare that an enemy will use them (the GM should usually reserve 
    enemy use of portal squares to the main antagonist of the overall 
    adventure). When a creature enters a portal square, they may spend 
    one square of movement to transport themselves to any other portal 
    square that they have discovered. Player characters also have the 
    option of transporting themselves to town (the return trip takes an 
    additional square of movement and must occur on a different turn, 
    see the [Going to Town](#going-to-town) section of the [Loot](#loot) 
    chapter for more information.)

Difficult Terrain
  : Difficult terrain could take any number of forms from a pile of loose
    rubble to a slippery ramp. This terrain makes movement difficult. A 
    character may choose to *either* spend two squares of movement for 
    each square of difficult terrain they enter, *or* they may choose to 
    take a -2 penalty to all die rolls until the beginning of their next 
    turn (this penalty is cumulative, so if they enter two squares of 
    difficult terrain, the total penalty would be -4 to all die rolls.)

Doors
  : Many rooms are separated by doors. Most doors will open freely, but
    it takes one square of movement to open a door. If a door is locked, 
    the character can spend an action to pick the lock (unless they have 
    the key, in which case, just treat it as an unlocked door.) If the 
    door is barred, or if it's locked and no one can pick the lock, the 
    character can make a skill check to push open or break down the 
    door. Use the table of [Difficulty Targets](#difficulty-targets) to 
    determine the die rolls needed for either picking the lock or 
    breaking down the door.

Traps
  : Some traps may be triggered simply by entering a particular square
    (pit traps, tripwires, falling ceilings, etc.) while others are 
    triggered when opening chests or doors. See the section on 
    [Traps](#traps) in [Building Encounters](#building-encounters) for 
    more information.

Obstacles
  : Obstacles are items in an area that can not be moved through with a
    normal walk or run movement. It is usually possible to fly over them 
    (provided the character has adequate movement) or to use a skill 
    check to climb over the obstacle.

Power Amplifiers
  : Any creature standing in a square containing a power amplifier gains
    a +2 bonus to any die rolls they make while standing in that square. 
    In a fantasy setting, this could be an area containing magical 
    runes. In a sci-fi setting, it might be a power generator that 
    boosts weapons and energy shields.

Power Drains
  : These are similar to Power Amplifiers but with a reversed effect:
    creatures standing in such a square take a -2 penalty to all die 
    rolls while standing in such a square.

Currents
  : When flying or swimming, either the air or water may be moving so
    swiftly in some areas that it effects a creatures movement. 
    Depending on the strength of the current (the GM decides this number 
    when creating an encounter area), a creature entering a square 
    affected by a current is pushed one or more squares in the direction 
    of the current. This is not cumulative, so if a current pushes you 
    into another square that also contains a current, only the first 
    current applies. While often a hindrance, currents can sometimes be 
    used effectively to allow a character to move further on their turn 
    than would otherwise be possible.

    If a current pushes a creature into an obstacle, the creature must 
    make a skill check with a difficulty target equal to 10 + the 
    strength of the current to avoid taking damage. For example, Boffin 
    the Bold flies into a strong wind and is slammed against the face of 
    a cliff. The wind current has a strength of 5, so the skill check is 
    made with a difficulty target of 15. If Boffin rolls a 15 or higher 
    (including any bonuses or penalties) he manages to escape harm. 
    However, if Boffin only rolls a 6, he will take 9 points of damage 
    for the difference between the difficulty target and his roll.
