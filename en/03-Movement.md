# Movement #

Character movement is a critical aspect of the game. The rules for 
movement determine how much of an area each character can explore on 
their turn as well as tactical positioning during combat.

All game play takes place on a battle map that is divided into 1x1 inch 
squares (as discussed in [Materials](#materials)). Each 1-inch square on 
the battle map represents five feet of movement. Various terrain 
features (e.g. a table, pile of rubble, wall or cliff) have vertical 
height as well as area on the map. Vertical movement is also counted as 
one square per five feet. No distinction is made between diagonal 
movement vs. movement along the rank and file of the battle map.

In the *Basic Grid Example* figure, assuming there are no terrain 
features that would otherwise inhibit movement in any direction, a 
character starting on square A can reach squares B, C, D and all squares 
in between within two squares of movement. This is true regardless of 
whether you consider the grid to be a horizontal or a vertical plane; if 
the bottom of the grid represents the ground and square A is 20 feet 
above the ground, a flying character could move to any of the same 
squares using two squares of their movement.
