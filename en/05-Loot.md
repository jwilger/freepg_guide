# Loot #

As the characters explore encounter areas and defeat enemies, each one 
will acquire loot consisting of treasure (items that are worth money but 
provide no bonuses) and enhanced items that aid in combat or have other 
beneficial effects. Sometimes an enhanced item will both provide a 
benefit and incur a penalty.

When placing loot in an encounter area, consult the *Random Loot Table*. 
Roll a d20 once for each enemy group that is placed in the encounter 
area, look up the loot in the table corresponding with each roll, and 
place the items somewhere in the encounter area.

## Going to Town ##

In addition to finding enhanced items while looting encounter areas, 
characters can got to "town" (you may wish to call it something else 
depending on your game's genre) to purchase enhanced items and healing 
potions. The greater the bonus provided by an item, the more it will 
cost, and items can be sold or traded for half of their purchase price. 
(Characters are free to trade amongst themselves without regard to the 
trade values specified below.)

A character can visit town by standing on any portal square (see 
[Terrain Features](#terrain-features)) and spending a movement square. 
The character can not return from town until there next turn. The return 
trip will also cost them one square of movement, but they may return to 
any portal square the party has discovered.
