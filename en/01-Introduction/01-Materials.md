## Materials ##

In order to play a FReePG game, you need only a few materials:

* **A battle mat** that you can draw on, pre-marked with a 1x1-inch 
  grid. Many game and hobby shops sell gridded paper for use with RPGs, 
  or you can get reusable wet-erase maps.

* **Colored markers** for drawing your maps. If you use a wet-erase 
  battle map, be sure you also use wet-erase markers!

* **Pencils** for each player and the Game Master.

* **Index cards** - Each player will need an index card to track their 
  character, and the GM will use index cards to track monsters and hand 
  out treasure during the game.

* **At least two 20-sided dice**, but preferably one for each player and 
  one for the GM.

* **Character Tokens** for each player character. Miniatures are 
  available at most game or hobby shops. You can also make your own 
  tokens[^NDMTCTP] if you have the patience and materials. Just ensure 
  that, whatever you use, you can distinguish each character, the tokens 
  will fit withing a 1-inch square, and they are stable enough that they 
  won't fall over as other pieces are moved on the battle map.

* **Monster Tokens** to represent the creatures that the characters will 
  battle. Similar to the character tokens, you can either find 
  miniatures or make your own tokens.

* **Health Tokens** for players to track their character's health 
  points. While it's possible for the players to just track their health 
  points with a pencil on their character card, (especially younger) 
  players might find it easier to start off with a pool of tokens and 
  simply discard/replace tokens as their health points change.

* **Imaginations** are, above all else, the most important part of the 
  game; every player and the GM must have one.
